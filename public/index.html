      Marker image fails to load if this stylesheet is loaded in JS.
      It would be nice to find a workaround to keep everything contained within the map container file,
      there are some worth investigating at:
        https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/issues/255
        https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/4968
      But for now this will do.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
